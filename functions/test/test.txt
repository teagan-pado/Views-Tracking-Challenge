We won't make you implement any tests for this challenge, 
but we still want to see how you think about testing your code. 

If you WERE to implement tests for your function, what cases would you test?

List each case below in plain english with it's expected result. 

Happy Path:
Case: New User (who exists in the collection) views a new Recording (which exists in the collection) for the first time
Expected Result: Expect all counters to increase from 0 -> 1 and a new recording is put into the user document

Case: New User (who exists in the collection) views an already existing Recording for the first time
Expected Result: Expect all counters to increase by 1, with the user getting a new recording view and the Recording adding to its total

Case: Existing User views a new Recording (which exists in the collection) for the first time
Expected Result: Expect all counters to increase by 1, with the Recording getting its first view and the User adding to its total

Case: Existing User views an existing Recording
Expected Result: Expect neither counter to increase and expect the recordingsViewed to not change for the User

Case: Multiple Users send off the same input values at the same time
Expected: The transactional writes allow us to only increase the counter once for the initial unique User/Recording pairing

Case: Multiple Users send off multiple acceptable inputs at the same time
Expected: All of the unique parings are handled correctly, updating all of the counters 

Edge Cases:
Case: New User (who does not exists in the collection) views a new Recording (which does not exists in the collection) for the first time
Expected Result: Expect the user fail gracefully, no counters are changed and an error log is thrown for debugging

Case: New User (who exists in the collection) views a new Recording (which does not exists in the collection) for the first time
Expected Result: Expect the user fail gracefully, no counters are changed and an error log is thrown for debugging

Case: New User (who does not exists in the collection) views a new Recording (which  exists in the collection) for the first time
Expected Result: Expect the user fail gracefully, no counters are changed and an error log is thrown for debugging

Case: New User (who does not exists in the collection) views an already existing Recording for the first time
Expected Result: Expect the user fail gracefully, no counters are changed and an error log is thrown for debugging

Case: Input empty User or Recording values
Expected: We return out early and throw a 400 with some information

Case: Input non-string values to either input
Expected: Application will return early and throw 
Actual: this passes at the moment 

Case: Input space ' ' for an input to either value
Expected: Application will return early and throw 
Actual: this passes at the moment 

Could probably go on to integration tests as well ...
